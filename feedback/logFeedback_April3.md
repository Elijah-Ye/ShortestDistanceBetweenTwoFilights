Reasonable goals (some clearly met -- proposal resubmission, some starting files). What is the purpose behind route.cpp vs flight.cpp? It's not clear the breakdown of functions (especially because route.cpp and .h are not present). 

Moving forward you should try to lock down what type of graph you will be using. Since Carl covered this on Friday, try to use the exact terminology of edge list / adjacency matrix / adjacency list going forwad.
